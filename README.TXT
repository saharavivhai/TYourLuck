you relaunch it.Read tutorials on my page in the Cheat Tools section!!!

Using autohack
--------------
first: select the game in memory
in the autohack menu: select enable debugger
select an line in the cheats list table and apply autohack on it
each time the game will write something at this address,the line will be logged
in the autohack window(menu:autohack,autohackwindow).
click on the check box for disable an line logged(nopping).


What do the TSearchDll.dll?
---------------------------
Used by Tsearch when the "fast search" is checked.


Can't get the autohack to work over the network
-----------------------------------------------
Only the search is usable currently.


Tsearch crashed and now after reload it look strange (black background,..)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Close Tsearch and delete TSearch.INI in windows directory.


After displaying the addresses found in the search box my system is slowed down
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
change the refresh time(view-options).
